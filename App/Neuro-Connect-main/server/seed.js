        content: `Being a student can be challenging, with academic pressure, social dynamics, and personal growth all happening simultaneously. Here are some practical tips to maintain good mental health during your academic journey:

1. **Establish a Routine**: Create a consistent daily schedule that includes study time, breaks, and self-care activities.

2. **Practice Mindfulness**: Take 5-10 minutes daily for meditation or deep breathing exercises.

3. **Stay Connected**: Maintain relationships with friends and family, even when busy with studies.

4. **Get Adequate Sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.

7. **Seek Support**: Don't hesitate to reach out to counselors or mental health professionals when needed.

Remember, your mental health is just as important as your academic success!`,
