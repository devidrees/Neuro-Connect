## Current Status üü¢

The client-side application is working correctly:
- Development server running on http://localhost:5173
- HTML file being served with 200 OK response
- JavaScript files being served correctly
- React application should now load in browser

The server-side is now properly configured:
- All dependencies installed
- CORS configured for correct client port
- Enhanced CORS support for multiple development ports (3000, 5173-5180)
- WebSocket proxy configured for Socket.IO
- Ready to start on port 8000

The database has been populated with sample data:
- Admin user: idrees@gmail.com / admin@123
- 5 verified doctors with different specializations
- 3 sample students
- 5 educational posts about mental health

The chat functionality has been significantly improved:
- Real-time messaging with Socket.IO
- Better error handling and connection management
- Modern, responsive chat interface design
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- File upload support for images and documents
- Proper file storage and serving configuration

## Next Steps to Consider üîÑ

### Server Startup
- [ ] Start the backend server with `cd server && npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify server connects to MongoDB successfully
- [ ] Test API endpoints are accessible

### Testing
- [ ] Test the application in browser to ensure React components load
- [ ] Verify routing is working correctly
- [ ] Check if authentication context is functioning
- [ ] Test API connections to backend server

### Backend Integration
- [ ] Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update MONGODB_URI in .env
- [ ] Test API proxy configuration from client to server
- [ ] Verify authentication endpoints are working

### Development Workflow
- [ ] Test hot reload functionality
- [ ] Verify build process works correctly
- [ ] Check if all dependencies are properly installed

## Notes üìù

The main issues were:
1. **Client**: Duplicate TypeScript files and wrong working directory for Vite
2. **Server**: Missing dependencies and CORS port mismatch

**Solutions applied:**
1. Removed duplicate TypeScript files
2. Fixed Vite configuration and package.json scripts
3. Installed all server dependencies
4. Updated multer to secure version 2.x
5. Fixed CORS configuration to match client port 5173
6. Removed all process.env dependencies and replaced with direct values

**Current setup:**
- Client: http://localhost:5173 ‚úÖ
- Server: Ready to start on port 8000 ‚úÖ
- API proxy: Configured from client to server ‚úÖ

**To start the backend server:**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Note:** All environment variables are now hardcoded:
- PORT: 8000
- JWT_SECRET: 'your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production'
- JWT_EXPIRE: '24h'
- MONGODB_URI: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/neuroo'
